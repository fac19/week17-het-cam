# User Stories

## Core

1. As a student I would like to create/have an account on the app so that I can use the platform.
2. As a student I would like to be able to watch videos so that I can quickly understand what the mission is.
3. As a student I would like to see how many tasks I have/have not completed in a mission so that I can keep track of my progress.
4. As a student I would like to see my completed mission badges so that I can feel rewarded.
5. As a student I would like to create my own user profile so that I can customise my experience.
6. As a student I would like to upload evidence of my completed tasks so that I can finish missions.
7. As an admin I would like a way of getting all user info so that I can see who has registered to the app, and what tasks they have completed.

## Stretch

1. As a student I would like to see what other people have done so that I can feel part of the community.
2. As a student I would like to download the app on my phone
